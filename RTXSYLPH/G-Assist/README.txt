README : SYLPH for G-Assist competition. 

A sylph is a mythological air spirit, first described by the alchemist Paracelsus, that represents the element of air, while the term is also used to describe a slender, graceful person. In folklore, sylphs are depicted as winged, ethereal beings associated with creativity and intelligence, embodying the qualities of air, and are often portrayed in romantic literature and ballet as graceful, fairy-like creatures. 
In folklore and mythology:
Sylphs are elemental spirits of the air, capable of creating both gentle breezes and violent storms.
They are associated with higher thoughts, intuition, and freshness.
Originally described by Paracelsus in the 16th century, they are part of a system of elemental spirits that also includes gnomes (earth), salamanders (fire), and undines (water).
They are often depicted with large wings and may have sharp, angular faces.
As a descriptive term:
"Sylph" can simply mean a slender, graceful woman or girl, similar to how the mythological creatures were depicted in romantic eras.
The term is used to describe a dancer's lightness and elegance on stage


I spent a full week working on this non-stop day and night and night and day.  It was a lot of fun continuing with my learning process of python and various programming languages.  Previously, I had successfully paired my PC with an API key to COLOSSUS DATA CENTER utilizing a specific set of tools and wired up my Hyper-X Quadcast S to speak directly to COLOSUSS DATA CENTER.  [and it worked!]  And I have a USPTO Patent [Filed] on that specifically as I not only did that - but I gave it some additional utility that I am speaking with some software companies about that I have interest in on my own software stack.   That said.  I did what I did utilizing Python 3.10.15 which is the version requirement needed to "do what I did with my custom voice hook"   It does not currently work on Python 3.14 which is the current iteration of Python. I tried Everything I could to get my competition entry for this Nvidia G-Assist competition working right utilizing Python 3.10.15 including running it in a virtual env, cross referencing Microsoft VS Code, MS NODE, Notepad, GitBash, and running everything through both Nvidia Nemotron 12b,  X.Ai GROK, LLAMA, Claude,  Microsoft Virtual Studio,  I mean -  all the nonsense.   At one point I upgraded to Python 3.14 but it tanked my own propiritary software stack so I had to revert to keep [the reason I own my own PC for stuff other than gaming] - working as intended.   I simply could not risk losing [my work] for this competition.  Still - I persisted.  And I "think"  SYLPH "works"  -  you let me know.  why did I name her RTX SYLPH?  a SYLPH =   Sylph (also known as Sylphid) is an air spirit. They are formed of air, they live in the air, and they have unusual power over the air, particularly the wind and the clouds. Usually, Sylphs are portrayed as guardians who protect secret knowledge, beautiful women, or the environment, but it’s not out of the question for a Sylph to cause mischief among men.  SO,  that seemed appropriate nomenclature for her "name" as a program.  Should I "win" this competition,  I will be upgrading my PC which is currently running an MSI 3070 gpu, which is the bare bones requirements for the "present day and age" we are living in.  And I would like to Build out a custom fabricated AI PC that can handle both my own proprietary software stack as well as carry the work I am doing into the "present day and age"  If selected as a winner,  I will pair the 5090  [a clean board with no dead cuda cells] with an appropriate current generation AMD RYZEN ThreadRipper cpu. I am woefully behind with an AMD AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor             (3.80 GHz) and it needs upgraded.  I mean.  I really need to build a new PC.  I can build stuff.  I build RC cars and Technic LEGO kits and can rebuild a real car.  But I haven't Built a PC yet.  SO, if i win, I will either have a local Pro Build it and clone my drives over  [or]  I will get Fancy, and figure out how to put the scratch together to get @pc_werkz on Insta to build me a custom config of his design.  His work is Dope!  I need some of his "Tower Art" living in my space.   but yeah.  so if i win a 5090 GPU I will pair it with the CPU it deservers.  Some AMD Threadripper,  but i don't know which one.   Appaerently AMD has this thing which is listed on Amazon.  I didn't even know there was a $12k CPU  "who knew"  I mean,  Like I totally know you can go absolutely Ham at a DATA CENTER level.  and even some towers can host up to 4 H100's and what not for a $150k'ish but yeah.  I had no idea that there was a prosumer CPU that was $12k until just now.  So,  like I drive a Prius.  I own it.  I repair and rebuild it as required.  SO, my "budget" might allow for a swank AMD CPU in the $1k price range, which I would fully be willing to do if I win a 5090.  I'll gladly accept the 5080 or the 5070,  but the thrill of building something is commiserate with the parts one has on hand for the build.  form follows function.  so modest - or "over the top" [considering] is what kept me pushing forward with this full week of programming and trial and error.  mostly error - due to running Python 3.10.15 which I require for my own software stack.  So yeah - it'd be Epic to win a 5090 and I'd put it to good use and I hope SYLPH installs and runs for you all!  She was a lot of Fun to Script!  regardless of the 5090, 5080, 5070, designators - if i win anything - I will still keep working on "SYLPH" for G-Assist and invite any commentary or help in that regard.  It's just a matter of whether the GPU gets put into a "Hot Rod" of a PC,  or a warehouse aisle gaming PC.  so if I win (anything) It'll get paired with an AMD RYZEN 5,7 or 9 ThreadRipper.  I just don't know which one yet.  Will have to do some research.  Unless AMD and AMAZON want to sponsor the build out of a PC_Werkz custom config and would be willing to sponsor it and to slam in that $11k CPU - because "who knew" and "why not" Sound's like a good time to me!  I have actually been speaking with a real neon glass bender out of Toledo who recently built a giant Mustang homage out of multi color neon and I have been kicking around ideas with him about how to incorporate artisanal (real neon / argon art glass) into a PC build while doing some outlandish stuff with 3D scanners, and 3D scanning a finished piece of neon glass with transformer and then putting that 3D scan into a CAD environment and then 3D printing a mold for a PC Tower  "not 3D printing the housing itself" mind you but 3D printing the mold and then utilizing the 3D printed mold to do either wet layup or vacuum formed carbon fiber processes as part of a carbon fiber course.  SO, it's possible to create the most outlandish custom carbon fiber and neon PC that the world has ever seen, and I would like to collaborate with a "Insert Video Game TITLE HERE"  video game Title to do something this totally outlandish and Rad.  So, IDK.  Select me as the Winner and network with me about how to do this other stuff that sounds like a lot of Fun - and could become cross industry marketing material that could be showcased every step of the way - which could also be filmed in 3-D live action and hosted in a purpose built metaverse for Kicks.  that's how I do all my programming btw.  Remote Desktop from my PC to an movie theater sized screen in a virtual environment.  This allows me to utilize my PC desktop and multiple AI interfaces there. i.e.  Nvidia Nemotron 12b,  X.Ai Grok, Llama 3 8b, Chat GPT, etc from my desktop on a movie screen directly in front of me and off to my left an additional browser instance with conversational voice as a Guide running from within the Quest 3.  So - I go full on into the matrix when i do this nonsense.  And I think all of the stuff I have described abouve-  I could also give some interesting TRADE-CRAFT specific Utility to Smart Glasses like the next generation wave form guide stuff that is coming.  SO, that's what I'd like to chit chat with "professionals" about If I win and anyone from any of these companies is interesting in collaboraring on a multi industry marketing and media Opportunity.  pps.  I own a 3D optical mechanical beamsplitter rig that is Serial #0000011 that has just been sitting around like a paperweight - awaiting 2 SONY FX3 cameras or 2 CANON C50 cameras and either Nisi Athena Primes or COOKE SP3 lenses which I can do all kinds of live action 3D with which can then be placed in a UNITY 3D gaming environment - or an UNREAL environment but I don't know UNREAL "yet"  hey, does anybody have $15k I can Haves to get a subscription to REALLUSION wink wink nudge nudge. working with computers is Rad but Expensive!  I mean....  For Real.  ANYWAY, Had a bunch of Fun creating SYLPH I hope she runs right on CUDA, RTX and G-ASSIST!   and Fingers Crossed I win the 5090!  I definitely want it!  

So if you've read all this:   I'm pretty sure the .exe has been formatted correctly.  but I've done so much work on this that "Grok" prompted me to subscribe to the (SUPER HEAVY) $300 a month subscription.  SO, I've got to wait 2 hours to let my preferred AI cool down from my hammering away at it.   the  SYLPH.PY script definitely is done right.  Spent a full week on the python script. the python script is solid.  So if you want to (run) it as a python file and know what you're doing -  give the code a once over and give it a whirl.  This is my first published GitHub anything ever - and from powershell had some trouble pushing the repo do to size so manually uploading everything and don't know 100% if that has affected my file structure or not.  Will give the .exe another go in the afternoon tomorrow once I can access "Grok" again.  This whole thing was constructed between Nvidia Nemotron 8b, X.ai Grok, Chat Gpt & Open AI pip installs,  all kinds of other pip installs,  cmd,powershell, Microsoft VS Code, Microsoft Virtual Studio, Notepad, CMD, Claude, I mean I pretty much utilized the full stack of everything you can think of to get this done.  the .exe or python [run] should automatically ask you to log your own user information or api key token to give ["SYLPH"] Utility and it should be a lot of fun!  Hope you can get it working on your system and you get some enjoyment out of my work on this.  It was a lot of fun making ["SYLPH"]
